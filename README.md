# HowsTheWeather
"HowsTheWeather" is a weather app that provides real-time weather information for any location you input. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve accurate temperature and weather condition data.

# Key Features
- Location-based Weather: The app allows you to input any location and instantly fetches the current temperature and weather condition using the OpenWeather API.

- Current Location Tracking: With user permission, the app can track the user's current location and provide the weather details for their precise location.

- Core Location Integration: The app utilizes Core Location framework to handle location services, ensuring accurate location tracking and retrieval of weather information.

- Delegate Design Pattern: The app demonstrates the use of delegates to establish communication between different components, enabling efficient handling of location updates and weather data retrieval.

- JSON Parsing: The app showcases effective JSON parsing techniques to extract relevant weather data from the API response and present it in a user-friendly manner.

# Technologies and Concepts Demonstrated
- API Integration: Interacting with the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data.

- Core Location: Implementing location tracking and retrieving user's current location.

- Delegation: Utilizing delegates to manage communication between different parts of the app.

- JSON Parsing: Parsing and extracting relevant data from the API response using Swift's JSONDecoder.

- User Interface: Designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to display weather information.

# Screenshots

* Implemented Core Location (CLLocation) functionality to track the user's location and retrieve real-time weather information within the application.
